    Duck can be food (i.e. duck nuggies), you can raise duck, love duck, maybe even marry duck. Duck also is very good pet. The best pet. Better than Goose. <br>
  Goose is way more aggressiver than duck. Duck is just like puppy. You can cuddle duck, hold duck, and even kiss duck. Goose are so boring. <br>
